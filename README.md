## Appendixes
### <a id="tech_stack"></a>Tech Stack
> We currently have established stacks we use for BackEnd & FrontEnd
> Which are:
>
> **BE:** C# with dot NET allocated on either TFS or ADO (AzureDevOps) environments.
>
> **FE:** HTML, CSS3, SASS, JS (Vue + Vuex)
>
> If there is a need or wish to use a different stack, for example `Node`, `PHP`, `Python`, `Go` etc. Different frameworks, like `Dot NET core`, `ReactJS`, `Angular`, `Symfony`, `Jango` etc. Maybe with different cloud service like `AWS` you will need to align this with Principals and Solutions Guild first.
